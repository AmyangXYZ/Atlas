# Atlas

Atlas (Advanced Twin Linkage And Synchronization) is a high-performance caching framework designed for real-time communication between physical systems and their digital twins. Built with Rust, it provides deterministic data delivery and state synchronization for digital twin validation and testing.

This project focuses on reliable, real-time communication infrastructure to support digital twin applications in time-sensitive environments. Atlas employs a distributed architecture where multiple nodes form a resilient mesh network. Users interact with Atlas through a simple interface while the system automatically handles complex operations like node discovery, data synchronization, and failover. This architecture ensures both high reliability for mission-critical applications and deterministic timing guarantees for real-time digital twin operations.

The framework implements advanced MAC layer scheduling mechanisms to provide precise timing control and resource management across the distributed system. The architecture is designed to incorporate security features inspired by blockchain transactions, where all data communications between nodes are signed and verified to ensure data integrity and authenticity while maintaining the framework's real-time guarantees.

At its core, Atlas features a self-organizing network design where each node functions as an intelligent access point in the distributed system. Nodes automatically discover, configure, and adapt their roles and resources based on system demands and network conditions. This autonomous operation ensures optimal performance and reliability while maintaining strict timing guarantees for real-time digital twin applications. The system supports seamless scalability - operators can easily deploy new nodes on additional machines to expand coverage and capacity, and the self-organizing network automatically integrates these resources to improve overall system performance.
